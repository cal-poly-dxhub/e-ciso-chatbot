**Unified Cybersecurity Framework:**

**Function 1: Asset and Risk Management (Incorporating CIS Critical Security Controls 1, 2, and NIST Identify Function):**

This function focuses on identifying and managing enterprise assets, understanding the business context, and assessing cybersecurity risks. Key outcomes include:

1.1 Asset Inventory and Management:
- Actively manage all enterprise assets, including end-user devices, network devices, servers, and non-computing/IoT devices.
- Establish an asset inventory to accurately track and monitor assets within physical, virtual, and cloud environments.

1.2 Business Environment and Risk Assessment:
- Identify the organization's role in the supply chain and critical infrastructure sector.
- Define cybersecurity policies and governance programs to establish a risk management strategy.
- Assess asset vulnerabilities, threats, and risk response activities to inform risk assessment.

**Function 2: Access and Data Protection (Incorporating CIS Critical Security Controls 3, 4, 5, 6, and NIST Protect Function):**

This function centers on protecting organizational resources, maintaining data security, and controlling access to assets. Key outcomes include:

2.1 Data Protection and Secure Configuration:
- Develop processes for secure data handling, classification, retention, and disposal.
- Maintain secure configurations for enterprise assets and software to prevent unauthorized access.

2.2 Identity and Access Management:
- Assign and manage authorization credentials for user accounts, service accounts, and administrators.
- Implement access controls to create, manage, and revoke access privileges to assets and software.

**Function 3: Threat Detection and Response (Incorporating CIS Critical Security Controls 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, and NIST Detect and Respond Functions):**

This function emphasizes the detection of cybersecurity events and the organization's ability to respond effectively to mitigate their impact. Key outcomes include:

3.1 Continuous Monitoring and Incident Detection:
- Develop a plan to continuously assess vulnerabilities on all assets and monitor for new threat information.
- Collect, review, and retain audit logs to detect, understand, and recover from attacks.

3.2 Incident Response and Recovery:
- Establish an incident response program with defined roles, policies, and procedures.
- Implement incident response and management capabilities to prepare for, detect, and respond to attacks.
- Conduct penetration testing to identify and exploit weaknesses, simulating attacker actions.

**Function 4: Awareness and Training (Incorporating CIS Critical Security Control 14 and NIST Protect Function):**

This function focuses on promoting a security-conscious workforce through education and training. Key outcomes include:

4.1 Security Awareness and Workforce Training:
- Establish and maintain a security awareness program to influence behavior and reduce cybersecurity risks.
- Provide role-based and privileged user training to empower staff and enhance cybersecurity knowledge.

**Function 5: Supplier and Recovery Management (Incorporating CIS Critical Security Controls 15 and 16, and NIST Protect and Recover Functions):**

This function addresses supplier risk management and recovery strategies to ensure the organization's resilience. Key outcomes include:

5.1 Supplier Evaluation and Application Security:
- Develop a process to evaluate service providers' cybersecurity capabilities to protect sensitive data and critical IT platforms.
- Manage the security lifecycle of software, preventing, detecting, and remediating security weaknesses.

5.2 Recovery and Improvement Planning:
- Establish and maintain recovery planning processes to restore assets and services affected by incidents.
- Incorporate lessons learned from detection and response activities to improve future strategies.
